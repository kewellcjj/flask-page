title: Markdown Cheatsheet
date: 2019-09-26
tags: [markdown, cheatsheet] 
excerpt: This post shows that this site is able to render markdown files almost identically to the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). A few differences are noted, and we show the support of Math expressions in our following post. 

# Headers
We force the the base level of header's to be 2 so that ```# H1``` will be rendered as ```<h2></h2>``` and thus has a smaller font than the article title. This bootstrap alert message is supported by ```markdown.extension.attr_list```.
{: .alert .alert-info role='alert' }
```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

======

Alt-H2
------

# Emphasis
We use html strik tag, for example, ```<s></s>``` for strikethrough while ```~~``` does not work here. Code highlight is suppoted by ```markdown.extensions.codehilite``` and ```markdown.extensions.fenced_code```.
{: .alert .alert-info role='alert' }
```hl_lines="7"
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. <s>Scratch this.</s>

# Lists
We need one blank line before and the other after the first unordered sub-list. We also require four spaces for the paragraphs within an list item. The numbers of the ordered list are required as we use ```markdown.extensions.sane_lists```. (In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)
{: .alert .alert-info role='alert' }
```hl_lines="4 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 14"
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item

*  Unordered sub-list. 

1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
2. Ordered sub-list
3. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

# Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

# Code and Syntax Highlighting
```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

# Tables
```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

# Blockquotes
```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

# Line Breaks
```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...⋅⋅
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
